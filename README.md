# Flight-Price-Prediction

In this project we predict the price of Flight ticket using Machine Learning

## Intuition

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travellers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. But if we have a right data anything can be predicted. Here with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between months and between various cities.

Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumerâ€™s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements. In this project we simulate work on some models for computing expected future prices and classifying whether this is the best time to buy the ticket.
